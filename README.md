# 🛏️ Smart Pillow for Snoring and Sleep Monitoring

This is my **first IoT project**, designed to help reduce snoring and monitor sleep quality.  
The pillow uses **sensors and IoT technology** to detect snoring and gently wake the person, allowing them to adjust their sleeping position. This helps reduce snoring to some extent and improves sleep quality.  

## 🚀 Features
- Detects snoring using sensors
- Slightly wakes the user with gentle vibration/adjustment
- Helps the person shift position to reduce snoring
- Monitors basic sleep activity
- IoT-enabled for real-time monitoring

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **IoT Sensors** (sound/vibration detection)
- **Microcontroller** (Arduino/ESP32 or similar)
